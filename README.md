# Belly Button Biodiversity

This project is an example of my Data Vizualization Skills 
utilizing a Plotly Library with JavaScript with data gleaned
from a JSON format. This webpage contains a dropdown of 153 
Test Subjects and for each one there is an interactive graph
that displays the top 10 bacteria cultures found in their
belly buttons, how often they wash their belly buttons and 
the bacterial cultures per sample.
